$ git -v
git version 2.47.1.windows.1

C:\Users\arund>java -version
java version "23.0.1" 2024-10-15
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 23.0.1+11-39)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.0.1+11-39, mixed mode, sharing)

But in this Project iam using Java 17

C:\Users\arund>mvn -v
'mvn' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file. 

Becoz i am not installed maven in my System.but it will work with out any issue,
becouse Eclipse have its own maven.
