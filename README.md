# Automation-Framework-Project-Swaglabs
Architected and implemented a professional-grade, end-to-end Hybrid Automation Framework utilizing Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Maven. Key features include full Page Object Model (POM) compliance, a dedicated Action Driver for reusable methods, Data-Driven Testing (DDT) capabilities, advanced logging (Log4j), and comprehensive reporting (Extent Reports). Specialized in driving high code quality and maximizing test coverage through architectural excellence.

# 🧪 Hybrid Test Automation Framework Structure

This document outlines the directory and file structure for the **Hybrid Framework (Selenium/TestNG/Maven)**, detailing the purpose of each component.

---

## 🏗️ Project Directory Structure

The following structure is used for the framework, organized primarily under the `src` directory as per standard Maven convention.

### **1. Source Code and Main Resources (`src/main/java` & `src/main/resources`)**

This section contains the core logic and configuration files of the framework.

| Path | Description | Type | Key Component |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`src/main/java`** | All main framework code, organized into packages. | Directory | Core Framework |
| &nbsp; ├── `com.actiondriver` | **[A1: Action Driver]** Contains utility class for common Selenium actions (e.g., clicks, sendsKeys) to enhance reliability and logging. | Package | Utilities |
| &nbsp; ├── `com.base` | **[A2: Framework Core - Base Class]** Contains the base class for framework setup and teardown (e.g., initializing WebDriver, reading properties). | Package | Core Logic |
| &nbsp; ├── `com.listeners` | **[A3: TestNG Listeners]** Classes for reporting, logging, and handling events like test start/end, including **Screenshots** on failure. | Package | Reporting/Listeners |
| &nbsp; ├── `com.pages` | **[A4: Page Object Model (POM) Pages]** Stores classes representing web pages, housing element locators and page-specific methods. | Package | POM |
| &nbsp; └── `com.utilities` | **[A5: Utility Classes]** General helpers like **Data Providers**, **Excel Reader**, **Logging** (`LoggerManager`), **Extent Report Manager**, and **Retry** mechanisms. | Package | Utilities |
| **`src/main/resources`** | Configuration files for the application and framework. | Directory | Configurations |
| &nbsp; ├── `config.properties` | **[B: Configuration Settings]** Key-value pairs for framework parameters (e.g., browser type, base URL, implicit waits). | File | Settings |
| &nbsp; └── `log4j2.xml` | **[C: Logging Configuration]** Configuration file for the **Log4j2** framework to manage logging levels and output format. | File | Logging |

---

### **2. Test Code and Resources (`src/test/java` & `src/test/resources`)**

This section houses the actual test scripts and the data/configuration required to execute them.

| Path | Description | Type | Key Component |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`src/test/java`** | Test code, organized into packages. | Directory | Test Scripts |
| &nbsp; └── `com.test` | **[C1: Test Scripts / Test Classes]** TestNG classes containing `@Test` methods that invoke methods from the POM pages. | Package | Test Scripts |
| **`src/test/resources`** | Resources used by the tests. | Directory | Test Resources |
| &nbsp; ├── `ExtentReport` | **[D1: Output - Extent Report Directory]** Directory where the final `ExtentReport.html` is generated. | Directory | Reporting Output |
| &nbsp; ├── `screenshots` | **[D2: Output - Screenshots Directory]** Location where screenshots are saved, typically on test failure. | Directory | Artifacts |
| &nbsp; ├── `testdata` | **[E: Data Driven Test Data]** Holds data sources like **Excel** files used for data-driven testing. | Directory | Test Data |
| &nbsp; └── `testing.xml` | **[C2: TestNG Execution Suite]** The main XML file used to define, group, and execute test cases. | File | Execution Suite |

---

### **3. Root Directory Files and Output Artifacts**

These files govern the project dependencies and configuration, and directories store the generated output.

| Path | Description | Type | Key Component |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pom.xml` | **[F: Project Dependencies & Management (Maven)]** Defines all project dependencies (e.g., Selenium, TestNG, Log4j2) and build life-cycle. | File | Dependency Management |
| `.gitignore` | Specifies intentionally untracked files/directories (like `target`, `logs`, IDE files) to ignore by Git. | File | Version Control |
| **`target`** | **[D4: Output - Maven Build Output]** Default output directory for all compiled classes and build artifacts. | Directory | Build Output |
| **`test-output`** | **[D5: Output - TestNG Default Report]** Default directory for TestNG-generated reports and execution data. | Directory | TestNG Output |
| **`logs`** | **[D3: Output - Log Files]** Directory where the framework's runtime log files are saved (e.g., as configured in `log4j2.xml`). | Directory | Artifacts |
| **`log4j2.xml`** | Configuration file for the **Log4j2** logging framework. | File | Logging Configuration |

---

### **System Dependencies**

* **JRE System Library [Java SE 17]**: The core Java Runtime Environment.
* **Maven Dependencies**: Libraries downloaded and managed by Maven based on the `pom.xml`.
* **TestNG**: The unit testing framework used for test execution and reporting.
