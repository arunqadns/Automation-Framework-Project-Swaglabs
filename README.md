# Automation-Framework-Project-Swaglabs
Architected and implemented a professional-grade, end-to-end Hybrid Automation Framework utilizing Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Maven. Key features include full Page Object Model (POM) compliance, a dedicated Action Driver for reusable methods, Data-Driven Testing (DDT) capabilities, advanced logging (Log4j), and comprehensive reporting (Extent Reports). Specialized in driving high code quality and maximizing test coverage through architectural excellence.
